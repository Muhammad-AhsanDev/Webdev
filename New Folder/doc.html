    <h3>About Us:</h3>
    <p><a href="https://saylaniwelfareusa.com/services/education/technical-education/saylani-mass-it-training" target="_blank">Saylani Welfare</a> International Trust was founded in 1999 by Maulana Bashir Farooq Qadri with a mission to serve the underprivileged segments of society. Headquartered in Karachi, Pakistan, the organization has grown into one of the largest welfare networks in the country, offering free medical care, daily meals to thousands, educational programs, job training, clean water access, and disaster relief.

We believe in sustainable development and self-reliance. Our projects are designed not only to provide immediate relief but also to empower individuals and communities for long-term growth. Through initiatives like the <a href="https://saylaniwelfareusa.com/services/education/technical-education/saylani-mass-it-training" target="_blank">Saylani Mass It Program</a>, we are creating employment opportunities and equipping youth with skills for the future.

Our vision is to build a society where no one sleeps hungry, no child is deprived of education, and everyone has access to basic healthcare and a chance for a better life.

With the support of generous donors and volunteers, <a href="https://saylaniwelfareusa.com/services/education/technical-education/saylani-mass-it-training" target="_blank">Saylani </a> continues to expand its impact—one lmife at a time.</p>
